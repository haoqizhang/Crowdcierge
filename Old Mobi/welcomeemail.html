      Congrats on signing up for Mobi! Now that you 
      are in, we can share with your personal Mobi pages and the link to send to your friends 
      to recruit them to help! We recommend that you bookmark the personalized links in this email for 
      easy access.<br/><br/>

     <b>You should start recruiting your friends right now!</b>  Here is the link to share with your friends as you recruit them to help:<br/><br/>

     The more friends you recruit, and the more of them that know about the place you are visiting, the better! You can recruit your friends via email, on Facebook, etc. <br/><br/>
